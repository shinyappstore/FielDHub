FielDHub is an application as well as an R package developed by the NDSU Big Data Pipeline team for conducting design of experiments (DOE). Design of experiments is a statistical approach used to optimize and enhance experiments efficiently. FielDHub is equipped to create both traditional and non-traditional augmented experiment designs, including spatial trials with checks assigned to plots in a diagonal arrangement across the field. Users can navigate an interactive DOE platform that facilitates the generation of randomizations for field, laboratory, and greenhouse experiments. Noteworthy features of FielDHub include the production of interactive field maps, tables, and field books, which can be extracted and saved. A unique aspect of FielDHub is its capability to generate simulated data for a response variable along with the randomization, making it a valuable tool for classroom teaching purposes.
